## Weekend Project - Javascript Game / Memory Game Weekend Project

This HTML, CSS, and JS was created during the weekend of July 14th through July 17th, 2016.  

The goal of this project was to create a working Javascript game.

The primary purposes of this exercise were to:

1. Gain experience planning and developing a project using BDD (Behavior Driven Development).  
For this project the Mocha testing framework was used with Chai BDD assertion library.

2. Gain experience with use of modules and creating prototypes using class based syntax.

3. Continue improving coding skills with regards to breaking functionality into various independent functions.

4. Continue improving skills in use of JS, HTML, CSS/SASS, and jQuery.
